Election
Trump won the Keystone State in 2016 by less than a point and lost it in 2020 by a bit more than a point. As a result of that, supposed misdeeds in the state have loomed large in the MAGA crowdâ€™s fraud narrative. Trump and others have alleged that Democrats directly stuffed ballot boxes during the counting in Democrat-controlled cities such as Philadelphia, or did so indirectly through fraudulently cast mail-in ballots.
